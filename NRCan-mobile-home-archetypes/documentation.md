# Notes on transport for modular homes #

## Summary: ##

-  Thicker walls = less interior room/area
-  Cantilevering isn’t usually an issue in Ontario at +/-16’ we are okay. However heavy loads or steel inside modules is a concern as the weight can be off-centered.
-  16’-4” = modules wrapped for transport. You need to take that dimensions and subtract: wrapping, wrapping protection, window brick mold projection, strapping (if needed), insulated sheathing, OSB, framing, room size, …then add everything again but in reverse.
-  Municipalities are allowed to adjust the restrictions so, keep in mind that MTO is only 400 roads, townships can have other permits
-  Stairs running parallel to the joists becomes an issue, especially with a landing. If Iimited to 15’-6”      (dim to exterior side of 2x6 framing) and you count +/-14 steps @ 9” VS 10” or 11” you go from 10’-6” to 11’-8” and 12’-10” respectively. Add      3’  for the landing and you have issues with narrow modules.
-  Weight is based on layout, configuration and will wildly vary. Modules are weighed at the closest highway weigh-ins.

 

The single trip permit is used by modular homes manufacturers in Ontario to transport modular units. They do not exceed 15.5 feet in module width, as there are other protrusions, such as transport wrapping, window ledges, etc.

### Single Trip Permits ###

A single trip permit is issued for a one-way trip along a specified route for a limited period. A carrier must apply a minimum of 3 business days prior to the proposed move date to allow the Permit Issuing Office sufficient time to process the permit request.

### "Superloads" ###

Superloads exceed any of the following limits:

-  120,000 kg gross vehicle weight

-  5 metres in width (16.4’)

= 45.75 metres in length

Permit applications for superloads of 6 metres or greater must include justification that demonstrates the necessity of transporting the loads on the province's highways, and require extra time and documentation. These loads will be subject to a thorough review by the ministry's Weight and Load Engineer, as well as various senior ministry management personnel.
